About Me 🧑🏻‍💻
I'm Max, a 21-year-old developer proficient in English, German, and with a basic understanding of Dutch. My coding journey began in 2016, and since then, I've immersed myself in the world of Java development. Over time, I've garnered extensive experience working with various databases and frameworks, including MySQL, MongoDB, ArangoDB, Redis, Hazelcast, RabbitMQ, Netty, Spring Boot, gRPC, Javalin, and more.

Development Tools 🛠️
In the past, I worked with Eclipse for coding, but currently, I leverage the power of the latest IntelliJ Ultimate version to enhance my productivity and efficiency.

Current Project: Seriuxmod 🚀
[Seriuxmod](https://github.com/seriuxmod) is an ambitious Minecraft client project that brings exciting features to enhance the gaming experience. This custom Minecraft client is equipped with a plethora of exciting functionalities, including:

🎭 Emotes and Cosmetics: Express yourself with a wide range of emotes and customize your character with cool cosmetics.
🎤 Voicechat: Interact and strategize with fellow players using the built-in voice chat feature.
🔒 Anticheat: Ensuring a fair and secure gaming environment by actively preventing cheating and exploiting.
🗣️ Sprachassistent: An intelligent voice assistant to aid you in navigating the client with ease.
🚀 Custom Launcher: Enjoy seamless access to Seriuxmod with its dedicated custom launcher.
The development of Seriuxmod takes place within the robust IntelliJ IDE. You can explore the code repository for this project here.

Programming Languages 💻
While Java remains my core competency, I'm continuously expanding my skill set by exploring web development technologies, including PHP, CSS, and JavaScript.
